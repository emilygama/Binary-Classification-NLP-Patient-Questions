    "## Notebook #1: Intro and EDA\n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook, I will introduce my project and explore my data. This will revolve around understanding the lanugage used by the consumers, patterns of use, and looking at randomly selected inputs. The notebook will finish with a brief look into my thought process for modeling and how I will be deciding my modeling direction.\n",

    "### Introduction and Background\n",
    "\n",
    "As a member of the data science team, I have been tasked with the second phase of our new online website product on medlineplus.gov from the US National Library of Medicine. This product allows consumers to input a question into our embedded chat feature. Our team has already built out a model to summarize the questions into a basic and logical form. This is where I come in: I will be building the model to differentiate between question content and direct them to our on-call specialists for answering. This chat feature will function similarly to an online customer service chat platform. In this second phase, I will focus on the classification feature and building out an initial chat interface to progress to the engineering team. \n",
    "\n",
    "Explicitly, my project will aim to build a binomial classification NLP model that identifies patient needs from an incoming message and matches that patient with a specialist to answer in real-time. This will be done using the MeQSum corpus, a dataset of 1,000 patient questions pulled from the US National Library of Medicine. These questions were then summarized by medical experts. The model I will build will use the natural patient question to identify whether the patient is seeking a pharmacist or internist to answer their question. I will build a chat-feature Streamlit app to highlight the importance of this model's work. This model would fit into a larger project outside the scope of this course but buildable in the long-term. The use case for a product like this would be embedded into a medical information website as a question asking chat feature. Patients would be able to ask a doctor a question, their question would be sorted to the correct specialist, and a specialist would be able to answer them.\n",
    "\n",
    "The most important metrics here will be accuracy and the F1 score. Msot importantly, I want to ensure I prioritize accuracy. In the medical field, it is of utmost importance that what we are telling our patients is accurate (predicting correctly overall) for their safety. For my project, it is not necessarily life-threatening if a question is categorized incorrectly, but minimizing that occurance is still a high priority. However, it is also important to ensure that my model is not disproportionately favoring one class over another because I have imbalanced data. This is why I will also look at the F1 score. The F1 score provides the harmonic mean between precision and recall (sensitivity). Now, I am truly after recall as it tells us about the correct positive predictions of the model, but because I have imbalanced data, using the F1 score will help evaluate the model's fairness in classification as well. This is important in identifying better or worse models for my use-case. \n",
    "\n",
    "The risks and issues with this project are clear from the outset. Ideally, I would have more data points than 1,000, more time to hand label questions (or use a program), and would be able to build a multi-class target (several specialties). When I initially labeled the data, I had about 20 classes of different specialties from pediatrician to infectious disease to dentists. I quickly realized that for this size of dataset, a multi-class project would not be feasible. Therefore, I trimmed it down to differentiating between pharmacist and internist (general MD or primary care physician). I made this decision because I noticed several medicaition-related questions that would best be answered by a pharmacist. This binary differentiation fell into place naturally. With this, however, I realize that the medical questions being classified to 'internist' may not always be relevant to that internist's work. Because there are a broad range of questions in this dataset, there are some questions that may be more suited for an ophthalmologist, dentist, pulmonologist, oncologist, etc. Because I made this a binary classification model, I am accepting that this project will help me identify a good starting point for what could be a great model in production. Further, because I hand-labeled the data, there is a risk that I mislabeled or misunderstood the question. To minimize this risk, I ensured I did research on symptoms, conditions, medications, and concerns when I did not have extensive background knowledge on the topic. I believe I labeled the questions as accurately as I could and to the best of my knowledge. \n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "As I continue in this notebook, we will explore the data and identify early trends. In identifying patterns of language between the two target classes, we can see anything but a clear divide in language. Both classes share several common words that may make modeling more difficult. "

She is unable to digest any formula milk or any milk products. When she was a new born, I started giving her Lactogen (a formula milk) a little bit along with my milk. She was fine with it but after 3 weeks, I switched her to another formula milk named Nan Pro 0 which is for babies upto 1 year. She started drinking that along with my breast milk. After 2 weeks, she started getting Diarrhea and a severe one where she pooped at least 15 times in one day. Therefore, I consulted the doctor and the doctor immediately asked me to put her on breast milk only. I did try that but she was hungry and crying therefore, I gave her a little bit of formula milk aswell. She was file with all the medicines. However, once the medicine stooped, she again started getting diarrhea. This continued on and off.\\n After a while, the doctor asked me to stop the formula milk and st...   \n",

Not only him, but just thinking how much his mom has suffered it really breaks my heart. I asked him how or what can I do to help him, he did not asked for money or something like, he just said: \"Would you help me to research how to get cured?\". Since I met my friend there is no one day I have stopped thinking in what can I do to make his dream come true.

    "The range of message word count is substantial. Patients seem to sometimes tell entire stories within their question, and others simply ask a basic and straightforward question. Luckily, the summarizer produced questions make these easier to understand. One issue that concerns me is the amount of extraneous information in the longer messages that do not get at the heart of the question. I suspect this may be an issue when it comes to modeling. The opposite concern exists for the short messages. The question related to erections could be asking about medications or other treatments. Because there is no other information, I did not assume the patient is asking for medications and instead directed their question toward an internist that may be able to help with a more holistic approach.\n",

    "As we reach the end of my EDA, I have seen that patients are asking many times for information about their own medical status, but also very often for help with their loved ones. They are asking about treatments and medications. They are asking for more knowledge, to be educated on what concerns or interests them. I can see that some patients are desperate for help and often very concerned. I believe that this product will be very useful for patients in seeking real time answers to their questions. \n",

I already know from the distribution of my target classes that the null model sits around 83% accurate when predicting just internist for every question. The models need to beat that to be productive. I also want to explore a topic analysis to see if any models can pick up what specifically the questions are asking about or if they can be grouped. The next notebook will explore these ideas."
